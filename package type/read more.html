        <h1> <br>Muthurajawela boat trip</h1>
        <p>Distance from Colombo 10km
            Time to reach Muthurajawela from Colombo 30 minutes
            Muthurajawela is situated around 10 kilometres from Colombo and its borders are marked by Negombo lagoon
            from the northern direction, Hendala towards the south, Uswetakeiyawa and beaches of Pamunugama towards the
            west and Colombo-Negombo main road in the direction of East.
            Muthurajawela boat trip is one of the popular Sri Lanka boat trips and many travellers, who spend their
            beach holidays in Negombo and Colombo take part in this program. Muturajawela wetland is a Ramsar wetland
            just north of Colombo near the popular beaches of Negombo, is a vast tract of land- most of Muthurajaela is
            hidden under the water even in the driest period of the dry season</p>
        <p>Most travellers, who travel to Negombo primarily are sun-worshippers; they enjoy the sun, sea, and sand, most
            travellers of Colombo skim over historical places, shopping malls, temples, and recreation centres but most
            of these travellers miss one of the most important natural attractions of Sri Lanka, which is none other
            than Muthurajawela wetland.

            The history of Muturajawela believes to be going back several centuries to modern times. It had been a
            thriving rice field in the western province of Sri Lanka. According to historical information, Muthurajawela
            had been the main source of rice for the people of the Kotte kingdom. During the kingdom of Kelaniya, there
            had been a mangrove forest in Muthurajawela.

            Muthurajawela wetland had been far bigger in the past than today, but due to the encroaching, a portion of
            the valuable wetland is turned into farmland and settlement. This habit of filling the valuable wetland with
            earth continues even today</p>
        <p>he name, Muthurajawela itself is derived from one particular rice variety cultivated in Muthurajawela.
            Muthurajawela, the word can be divided into three parts Muthu =pearl, raja=King and wela= rice field,
            denoting “the field, where a variety of rice, looks like mutu (pearl) cultivated for the king”.

            There is another legend with regards to the beginning of the name of Muthurajawela. When King Sri Wira
            Parakramabahu (1473-1497) reigns in the country, a farmer called Muthuraja arrived in Sri Lanka and
            introduced a variety of rice from India.

            The king was very pleased with the introduction of a new rice variety due to its unique taste. Later the
            farmer was provided with all the labour and other facilities by the king, in order to carry on the
            cultivation of rice in Muthurajawela. Not only the farmer was given the king’s patronage but also the rice
            field was named after the Indian farmer who introduced the rice variety.

            The rice cultivation was abandoned with the arrival of the Dutch on the island. Dutch administration built
            the Dutch canal that goes through Muthurajawela. The canal begins in Negombo and goes along the beaches of
            the west coast up to North-West Sri Lanka.

            The canal was used for transporting goods from northwest Sri Lanka to Colombo and Negombo. Unfortunately,
            the salty water of the canal mixed with the freshwater of Muthurajawela, making it unsuitable for rice
            cultivation. The abandoned rice field has gone through many ecological changes in the past and it has turned
            into the most important wetland on the island today.

            Today Muthurajawela is measured to be around 20 Square kilometres. According to naturalists, it is one of
            the most important wetlands with very rich bio-diversity in the country. About 40 species of very rare flora
            species can be found among the 179 species of grass, plants, shrubs, and trees in Muthurajawela.

            It has a very high concentration of avian fauna species. Especially Muthurajawela is inhabited by a large
            number of aquatic bird species. 130 different species of birds were recorded in Muthurajawela, out of which
            85 species are resident birds while 45 species are rare migrant bird species. Muthurajawela wetland is the
            home of many rare species of fish on the island. There are several species of butterfly that also can be
            seen in Muthurajawela.

            Muthurajawela was declared a wildlife reserve on 31st October 1996. Muthurajawela is divided into two parts
            part one is spread over 1028 hectares while part two occupies more than 250 hectares.

            Muthurajawela is one of the most popular places among the holidaymakers on the island for bird watching. The
            best way to explore Muthurajawela is with a boat and a boat tour is offered as a one-day excursion from
            nearby hotels.

            Madu river safari is one of the most popular boat rides among holidaymakers anchored on the west coast of
            Sri Lanka. A large number of travellers especially people, who spend their beach holidays on the west coast

        <p>Madu river safari allows travellers to witness the rich riverine environment of Sri Lanka. The Madu rover
            estuary gives you a perfect opportunity to see the endangered mangroves. The mangrove forests are depleting

            as Wildlife parks, beaches, forts, museums, parks and town</p>


        <h1> <br>Bentota River boat tour</h1>
        <p>entota River is located bordering the Bentota beach resort and it is 100km south of Colombo. Bentota River is
            located between the Madu river estuary and Colombo. When it comes to boat tours on the west coast of Sri
            Lanka Madu river boat tour is the most popular and Bentota boat tour comes behind it. However, I feel the
            boat tour of Bentota River is more interesting than the boat tour at Madu estuary. But coat tour of Madu
            estuary is widely popular among the local as well as foreign travellers and therefore, most travellers
            venture on the Madu river safari. At a time madu river can be very crowded due to the concentration of a
            large number of travellers.

            When it comes to the Bentota river boat tour, you rarely encounter any other party on the boat tour. The
            Bentota boat tour is not as popular as the Madu river safari and therefore it does not attracts a large
            number of travellers. Only a few numbers boat tours take place on a day means the wild animals are less
            disturbed and impact on the nature is minimal. If you have done bait boat tours based on Madu river estuary
            and Bentioat river you can ascertain it.</p>


        <p>Bentota boat tour is ideal for wildlife enthusiasts and visitors are able to witness many animals such as
            crocodiles, water monitors, monkeys and snakes during the Bentota boat tour. But the visitors encounter wild
            animals very rarely on the Madu River boat tour, this is mainly due to the large number of motor boats that
            takes tourist along the river every day. On the other hand, the Mangrove forest in the Bentota River is far
            bigger than the Madu river estuary.</p>

        <h1> <br>Mangrove tunnel</h1>
        <p>You might be wondering what the mangrove tunnel is. Because tunnels are to be found in cement, metal and rock
            but a tunnel made of mangrove, is definitely a little bit awkward. Even though it sounds a bit strange, you
            can witness a mangrove tunnel during boat trips. Your boat will travellers through the mangrove tunnel.

            The mangrove tunnel is formed by huge mangrove trees, which are rising up to many hu7ndred feet in some
            places. These giant mangrove trees reside on the shallow, muddy surface of the river bank. Its roots are
            poking into the air and work like noses trills of mangrove trees, and help the tree to absorb air into the
            system.</p>
        <p>Whether it is Madu River boat safari or Bentota River boat safari you will encounter a mangrove tunnel. But
            the mangrove tunnel at Bentota river is much bigger than the tunnel found in Madu river estuary. The
            Mangrove tunnel in Bentota River is many hundred feet high in some areas and its with roughly about 20 feet.
            The tunnel of the Bentota River is about 200 meters in length and it takes about 10 minutes to go from one
            end to the other in a motorboat.

            However, the mangrove tunnel of Madu river estuary is much smaller and less attractive than the tunnel found
            in Bentota River. Furthermore, the Bentota River is very wide and deeper than the Madu River estuary,
            Bentota River is the 5th biggest River in Sri Lanka. However, Madu estuary is smaller compared to the
            Bentota river and shallower than the Bentota River. There are 64 islands of varying sizes within Madu River
            estuary but there is no island to be found in the Bentota River, and it is flanked by the mainland.</p>
        <h1> <br>Udavalawe</h1>
        <P><BR>Udawalawe National Park is a national park on the boundary of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces in Sri
            Lanka. The park was created to provide a sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction of the
            Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River, as well as to protect the catchment of the reservoir. The reserve
            covers 30,821 hectares (119.00 sq mi) of land area and was established on 30 June 1972.[1]

            Before the designation of the national park, the area was used for shifting cultivation (chena farming). The
            farmers were gradually removed once the national park was declared. The park is 165 kilometres (103 mi) from
            Colombo. Udawalawe is an important habitat for water birds and Sri Lankan elephants. It is a popular tourist
            destination and the third-most visited park in the country.[2</P>
